# Bitwise math

In order to better understand the fundamentals by which the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) works, I've written a couple of functions that perform simple arithmetic operations using only logical operators and loops.

## Examples

```
Values: **************************************
a = 15 = 1111
b = 3 = 0011

Operations: **********************************
[Addition] Half Adder: 15 + 3 = 0001 0010 = 18

[Subtraction] Half Subtractor: 15 - 3 = 1100 = 12

[Multiplication]: 15 x 3 = 0010 1101 = 45

[Division]: 15 รท 3 = 0101 = 5

[Power]: 15^3 = 1101 0010 1111 = 3375

[Sqrt]: sqrt(25) = 0101 = 5

is 15 odd? True
is 3 odd? True
```
